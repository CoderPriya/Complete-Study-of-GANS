**Screen shot from my notes** 
![Building Blocks](/images/building-blocks.jpg)
## Requirements

* `numpy (1.16.3)`
* `keras (2.2.4)`
* `matplotlib (3.0.3` (v2)

## About

* Goal - To understand working and flow of discriminator and generator
* Dataset used - MNIST digits
* Built on - Kaggle (GPU + internet enabled)

## What's next

* Visualization of results (v2-added)
* Related notes (v3-added)
